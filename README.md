# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System
This project is a web-based multiple disease prediction system built with Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit (Spyder). It provides a simple and interactive interface where users can enter medical parameters to get predictions for: 
  1. Diabetes
  2. Heart Disease
  3. Parkinsons Disease
  4. Breast Cancer

#  Features

- Interactive sidebar menu for selecting the disease
  
- Accepts relevant medical input parameters for each condition

- Uses trained ML models to predict the likelihood of disease
  
- Displays a clear and immediate result ("has the disease" / "does not have the disease")
  
- Built with Streamlit for a smooth and responsive web UI

#  Tech Stack

- Python

- Streamlit

- Scikit-learn
  
- Pandas / NumPy
  
- Pickle (for loading saved models)

#  How it Works
  Each disease has its own prediction model trained on real medical datasets. The user selects a disease from the sidebar, enters the required parameters, and receives an instant prediction based on the input.
